## App Store Summary

The Simple Saver is an easy to use budgeting application to help you stay on your budget. Simply choose your budget, then track your transactions and let The Simple Saver keep you on track! Adding transactions is easy all you have to do is stay in your budget. The Stash feature also allows you to accumulate extra income to your budget by stashing it in a separate section of the app. Won a game of poker? Got some extra cash for your birthday? Throw it in your stash as a stash transaction and watch your stash grow. At the beginning of each new month you will also receive a monthly report telling you how you did last month. If you stayed within your budget and have any extra money leftover it will automatically be added to your stash for future use. Be careful though because it will also be automatically deducted from your stash if you go over. You should think of your stash as extra money to save or spend that exceeds your budget. As long as you have a positive stash you will always be on budget. You can also compare past months in the history page and see which months you did good or could do better.

If you enjoy the app and it helps you keep a budget please leave a review and let me know!
